# 🌿 Indian Medicinal Plant Identification using CNN

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to identify **Indian medicinal plants** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on **MobileNetV2**.  
A **Flask web application** is used to serve the trained model and provide an interactive interface where users can upload plant leaf images and receive predictions along with their **medicinal uses**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various Indian medicinal plant leaves.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: TensorFlow & Keras Compatibility
> 🚨 **This project works ONLY with supported versions of TensorFlow and Keras.**

The model was trained and tested using:
- **TensorFlow:** `2.13.x`
- **Keras:** `2.13.x`

Using newer or incompatible versions **may cause runtime errors or model loading failures**.

✔ Recommended versions are listed in `requirements.txt`  
❌ Do NOT upgrade TensorFlow/Keras arbitrarily
